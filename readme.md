Download the dpaint disks from archive.org and extract the example lbm files 
then convert them all to gifs and pngs without remapping the palettes.

Unfortunately the original format is hard to use and most modern versions of 
these files that you can find on the internet have been mangled by converters 
that do not respect palette information. 

This is an attempt to maintain access to the original art by converting it 
correctly into more accessible file formats.

Run the bash scripts in numerical order on a recent debian install to hopefully 
recreate the data files.
